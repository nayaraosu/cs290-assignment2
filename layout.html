			Why I’m pursuing a CS degree: I had taken a few computer science courses at JHU, but I did not enjoy the program at the time. After graduating, I began working in Visual Effects and Animation and ended up programming more and more as my career progressed. The VFX and animation industry is kind of a mess right now and all the technical wizardry I know is not really applicable to careers outside the VFX industry so I decided to enroll in this program to broaden my knowledge. I’m really enjoyiwng it so far!

			During my time as Johns Hopkins University, I took classes in Java but did not use it much after graduation. However, the basic fundamentals of programming stuck with me and I was able to pick up Python while working on the job. I’ve been using Python for around six years now and have used it to create some command line scripts as well as GUI based tools (using PyQt) for coworkers and myself. Recently, I picked Java back up again in order to develop some Android applications for personal use. I also have a great deal of experience using Linux command lines, specifically things like awk and sed. When I get free time, which is not very often, unfortunately, I play around with Arduino and write very basic C programs. This is all in addition to what I have learned in cs161 and cs162. My favorite programs I have written were an Uno card came in cs161 and an RPG/Maze game based of The Avengers in cs162.
